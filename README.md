# bitwarden-azure-terraform
Terraform scripts for those who want to run Bitwarden in an Azure Contaner App using their unified self-host.

## :warning: Current Status: Barely Started, Abandoned :warning:

I'm worked on these scripts in real-time, with limited knowledge of BitWarden. I'll try to make releases along the way, but definitely DO NOT BLINDLY TRUST WHAT IS HERE. This is your security; take it seriously.

Furthermore, I decided that I didn't want to self-host a security solution when hosted solutions were enough. Hosted BitWarden seems like a fine choice, but I ended up going with 1Password.
